### Hello! I am Nicole ðŸ‘‹

It is exciting to be in this ever growing digital space and introduce myself.

I am a data science enthusiast, currently pursuing data science as my profession. I have professional background in accounting and finance over 10 years and ever since I decided to transform my career trajectory into data science and machine learning three years ago, I have been training myself through master's degree program, professional certificate and diploma programs in various educational institutes and training through many means and facets. I have to say that my progress in this endeavour so far has been very humble and I feel that I still have a long way to go, but I am very happy that I chose to have this journey - as I learn more and more, I realize that AI and ML are fascinating and I want to continue to learn and grow in this space.

My passion is in learning and doing projects related to NLP, Time Series models, Computer Vision, Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning and any topics related to artificial intelligence. I am doing data analysis using Twitter API and other public API, experiments on deep learning and transformer models, and generative AI Art, which is my ongoing project.

I would also love the opportunity to collaborate any projects, Hackathon or other challenges with you to develop the skills and applications together!
